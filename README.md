# Case study
The goal for the project was to create a tribute page for a subject of my choosing, fictional or real. I decided to make a tribute page about Irena Sendler, who played a vital role in saving the life of thousands of Jewish children during the Holocaust. Made entirely with HTML and CSS, a simple structured SPA from top to bottom.
